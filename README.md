# Jetstream Turbo Rewrites

This repo is aimed at creating other language versions of jetstream-turbo by graze.social.

It is vibe coded from the original source code. The LICENSE for the python code remains unchanged as well as the source code itself. I just moved the python code into its own folder so that I could use the source code as context for OpenCode.

The original source code is available at https://github.com/graze-social/jetstream-turbo
