{"id":"jetstream-turbo-9ux","title":"Implement major performance optimizations: batching and parallelism","description":"Implement critical performance optimizations to improve throughput and reduce latency in jetstream-turbo.\n\n## Optimizations Required:\n\n### 1. SQLite batch inserts\n**Current:** Individual INSERT statements in orchestrator.rs\n**Target:** Use store_batch() for bulk inserts\n**Expected gain:** Significant reduction in SQLite write overhead\n\n### 2. Parallelize SQLite + Redis operations\n**Current:** Sequential operations per batch\n**Target:** Run SQLite writes and Redis operations concurrently using tokio::join! or FuturesUnordered\n**Expected gain:** Better utilization of I/O parallelism\n\n### 3. Parallel message hydration\n**Current:** Sequential message processing\n**Target:** Use FuturesUnordered for concurrent hydration of multiple messages\n**Expected gain:** Reduced latency for batch processing\n\n### 4. Buffer reuse optimization\n**Current:** Using drain().collect() which allocates new Vec\n**Target:** Use Vec::clear() to reuse existing buffer allocation\n**Expected gain:** Reduced allocation pressure and GC overhead\n\n## Success Criteria:\n- All four optimizations implemented\n- Benchmarks show measurable improvement\n- No regression in correctness or reliability","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"cmgriffing@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-13T17:13:47.264059-08:00","created_by":"Chris Griffing","updated_at":"2026-02-13T17:14:54.589927-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-13T17:14:54.589927-08:00","close_reason":"Successfully implemented all four major performance optimizations: 1) SQLite batch inserts using store_batch(), 2) Parallelized SQLite + Redis operations with tokio::join!, 3) Parallel message hydration using FuturesUnordered, 4) Buffer reuse with Vec::clear() instead of drain().collect().
